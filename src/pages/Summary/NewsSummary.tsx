        PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Monday urged Chief Election Commissioner
        (CEC) Sikander Sultan Raja to resign, claiming that his party won the
        Punjab by-polls despite the use of state machinery in PML-N's favour as
        he insisted that early elections were still the only solution to the
        country's woes.
        <br />
        <br />
        In an address today after his party's triumph in the Punjab
        by-elections, he thanked youngsters and women who came out in large
        numbers to vote for PTI.
        <br />
        <br />
        "I believe this is the moment in the history of Pakistan that we should
        be thankful for because the nation has awakened," Imran remarked.
        "People have finally understood the ideology of Pakistan." The
        ex-premier, however, stressed that Pakistan was facing an economic
        crisis that was fueled by the political mess in the country. He
        highlighted that amid these crises, the only way out was free and fair
        elections. But, Imran contended, those elections should not be conducted
        the way by-elections in Punjab were held. "[During the by-polls] they
        used all the tactics to defeat us. Police threatened our people.
        Officers acted as workers of PML-N," he claimed, adding that Punjab
        Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz had no right to use the police in such a
        way. He also claimed that there were four million deceased voters
        included in the electoral rolls.

          CEC Raja should resign
        </h5>
        Separately, Imran claimed that the CEC tried his best to turn the polls
        in favour of the PML-N. "I am disappointed in the chief election
        commissioner. How could he let all this happen? He is not competent to
        run [the Election Commission of Pakistan] and is biased towards a
        political party. Raja should immediately resign.
        <br />
        <br />
        "He said that his party did not trust the CEC, citing the example of
        Senate elections in 2021 in which Imran said evidence of bribery was
        seen. "In Sindh's LG (local government) elections, 15 per cent of PPP
        candidates won unopposed, yet nobody investigated it," he recalled.
        "During the Daska polls, the returning officer opened all the votes
        against PTI. He made us lose that election.
        <br />
        <br />" He said that despite several cases of rigging during polls being
        brought before the CEC, he never punished anyone, which encouraged
        malpractice as no one feared accountability. But, despite all these
        tactics, Imran said: "We won as people came out to cast their votes like
        never before. At the outset of his speech, the PTI leader said that he
        was elated today because the nation had finally started questioning
        slavery. “We have rejected slavery and we will now become a nation with
        the grace of God.” Referring to the incumbent government, he said that
        all the leaders had their money stashed abroad.
        <br />
        <br />
        “They say they are ready to die for Pakistan but spend vacations
        overseas,” he highlighted. But, he continued, the way women and
        youngsters came out last night, they had proven that “we are finally in
        the Naya Pakistan”. He went on that during the the PML-N's previous
        tenure of five years, Pakistan did not see a rise in exports.
        <br />
        <br />
        "They left huge fiscal deficits in both their terms. They came to power
        only to get cases against them quashed. They got bills passed from the
        assembly. "But god willing, I will challenge all this in the Supreme
        Court tomorrow (Tuesday)," the former PM vowed.
